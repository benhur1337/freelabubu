            <Title>Terms and Conditions of Use in This Website</Title>
            <Heading>You Lose We win ALWAYS</Heading>
            <div>Every bet placed is a non-refundable donation to our fabulous offshore accounts. We will use unclear and ever-shifting odds to maximize our advantage. Don't expect fairness, that's for suckers</div>
            <Heading>Withdrawal? What Withdrawal?</Heading>
            <div>Withdrawing your winnings is a privilege, not a right. We may delay, deny, or restrict withdrawals for any reason, because...we can.
    Minimum withdrawal amounts will keep increasing mysteriously, just like your frustration.</div>
            <Heading>Bonus Bonanza For Us Not You</Heading>
            <div>Our bonus offers are designed to keep you playing, not winning. Expect complex wagering requirements and hidden fees that make winning back your bonus near impossible.</div>
            <Heading>We Can Change the Rules Whenever We Want</Heading>
            <div>These terms and conditions are like playthings for our lawyers. They can twist, bend, and rewrite them at will. Your complaints are like background noise to us.</div>
            <Heading>Your Problem, Not Ours</Heading>
            <div>Gambling addiction? Not our monkeys, not our zoo. We won't take any responsibility for your financial ruin or broken relationships.</div>
            <Heading>We Don't Like Questions</Heading>
            <div>Contacting us about disputes is a waste of your time. Our customer service is trained ninjas in the art of deflection and denial.</div>
            <Heading>By Clicking "I Agree," You Agree to Everything (Even the Bad Stuff We Forgot to Mention)</Heading>
            <div>Clicking that button is your soul contract with us. You're giving up all your rights and waving goodbye to your sanity.</div>
            <Heading>You Entered, You Lose. Have Fun (Not Really).</Heading>
            <div>Welcome to our rigged casino! We suggest lowering your expectations and preparing for disappointment.</div>
            <Heading>Remember, We Take All the Cookies (and Your Money)</Heading>
            <div>We track your every move and bet. This data is ours to sell, exploit, or use for any nefarious purpose we see fit. Consider it a bonus for losing.</div>
